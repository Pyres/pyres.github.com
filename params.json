It is backed by redis and relatively simple to use. Currently we have 3 separate tools that can be used together to process and view your jobs\r\n\r\n## [pyres](https://github.com/binarydud/pyres)\r\nThe original project in the stack, pyres is the primary workhorse for queueing and working on jobs. It's the library that handles adding jobs to the queue and also pulling them off and processing the jobs. Pyres is based on the resqueue job processing framework in ruby.\r\n\r\n## [resweb](http://github.com/pyres/resweb)\r\nOriginally part of pyres, resweb was moved into it's own project to encourage growth and to keep dependencies lower for pyres. Resweb is a web dashboard to the current state of a redis server being used by pyres.\r\n\r\n## [django-pyres](https://github.com/Pyres/resweb)\r\ndjango-pyres is the first integration project between pyres and django. It allows a django project to easily queue jobs and run workers.\r\n\r\n##Coming Soon\r\n"}
